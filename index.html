                <p>My name is Rick Picolli, 30 years old, and I am a psychologist. </p>
                <p>I always thought that I wanted to help people and by doing that, I thought that psychology was the best way to achieve this and I really liked studying people, but when I started working as a psychologist treating people in a clinic or when I started work with human resources, I discovered that this wasn’t something that makes me happy in my daily life, so I started thinking about what could make me happy and I discovered coding.</p>
                <p>I really like the idea of creating something from nothing and this creation could help or make difference in people’s life, so that is why I became so passionered about it.</p>
                <p>I didn't have any experience with programming before, so it has been quite a challenge for me, but I know that with my hard work, I can do it.</p>
