                <p>My name is Rick Picolli and I hold a bachelor's degree in Psychology from Lutheran University of Brazil (ULBRA). </p>
                <p>I was always passionate about helping people and in order to achieve this goal in my life I became a psychologist.  Besides that, I really enjoyed studying the human nature.</p>
                <p>However, by the time I started working as a psychologist, treating people in a clinic or working with human resources, I realized that this wasn’t something that makes me happy in my daily life. Therefore when I moved to San Francisco I started thinking about changing my career and what could make me happy. After a lot of reflection and studying, I discovered that coding could be what I was looking for.</p>
                <p>I really like the idea of creating something from scratch and with the potential to help people or make a difference in their lives This is the reason I became so passionate about coding.</p>
                <p>Along the Full-Stack Web Development BootCamp of UC Berkeley and after working hard on each project, I already learned the whole process of Frontend Web Developer and by April 2018, I’ll get the whole package to be a complete Web Developer or Software Engineer, capable of working using JavaScript, Python, Node.JS, Databases and more.</p>
